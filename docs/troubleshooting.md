# Troubleshooting

Everything below writes to **stderr**, so you will see it even when you redirect
the transcript to a file.

## Nothing appears for a non-English language

Look for this line:

```text
! dropped 3 low-confidence segment(s) [lang=bn, script=indic]
```

Whisper heard you and the confidence gate rejected the result. If it fires on speech you know was clear, the thresholds are still too tight for your audio — [open an issue](https://github.com/rokib16x/listnr/issues/new/choose) with the line, the language, and the model. `/model whisper-large-v2` usually clears it, because a better model scores higher.

If there is no such line and the level meter shows `mic=0.000`, it is the microphone, not the transcription. Check System Settings → Sound → Input, and run `listnr doctor`.

## The transcript has gaps — minutes of speech missing

Look at the level meter while you talk:

```text
  levels  mic=0.017  sys=0.000
```

Speech has to reach **0.018** at `normal` sensitivity before a finished segment
is kept. A built-in MacBook microphone at default input volume often peaks around
0.017, which is under the bar — so audio is captured, never transcribed, and the
transcript simply has holes in it. Listnr now says so ~20 s in:

```text
! mic peaked at 0.017 but speech needs 0.018 — most of your voice is being discarded.
```

Two fixes, either works:

1. **Raise the input volume** — System Settings → Sound → Input, drag the slider up.
2. **Lower the bar** — `/sensitivity high` halves every threshold, or
   `listnr start --sensitivity high`.

Use `low` for the opposite problem: a hot microphone where keyboard noise and
fans get transcribed as words.

## Words go missing in the middle of a conversation

```text
! You: dropped 12 audio buffer(s) and 4 speech segment(s), transcription could not keep up. Try a smaller model.
```

The model cannot transcribe in real time on your machine, so the pipeline discarded audio rather than growing without bound. Move **down** the [model table](models.md#models): `whisper-large-v2` → `whisper-large-v3-turbo-fast` → `whisper-small`. This is why the non-English defaults are not the largest models.

## The transcript is gibberish, or repeats itself

Usually one of three things:

1. **`/lang auto` guessed wrong.** It commits to one language per session, so a bad guess affects everything after it. Check the `detected language:` line, and name the language instead.
2. **The model is too small for the language.** `whisper-tiny` and `whisper-base` produce confident nonsense on Indic languages. Move up the [model table](models.md#models).
3. **A decoder loop.** Whisper sometimes repeats a phrase indefinitely. Listnr detects and drops these, but a line that repeats a phrase two or three times can still get through.

If output is in the *wrong language* while `/translate` is on, you are on a turbo model. Listnr should have prevented that — please report it.

## It is slow to start

The first `/live` for a given model downloads and compiles it for the Neural Engine. That is once per model, and the progress bar shows it. Pre-fetch before a call:

```sh
listnr models download whisper-large-v2
```

## `/lang bn` wants a 908 MB download

That is `/translate` being on, which switches to `whisper-large-v2`. Turn it off for a native-language transcript, or use `/model whisper-small` for a 207 MB translation model.
